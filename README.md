# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

## Project Overview  
This website allows users to interact with [brief description of the core functionality]. It's built using Svelte, a modern JavaScript framework that ensures fast performance and easy reactivity.  

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```
```bash
# or use yarn or pnpm
npm install
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters) for your target environment.
# Message Application

## Project Overview

This project is built using **Svelte**, a modern JavaScript framework that simplifies UI development. It features a simple structure with a **header**, **main content area**, and **footer**. The main functionality of this project involves displaying and dynamically updating a **message** using Svelte's **reactivity** and **two-way data binding**. This makes the app responsive and user-friendly.

The project showcases:
- **Svelte components**.
- **Reactivity and dynamic state management** using `$state`.
- **Two-way data binding** to interact with the UI.

## Getting Started

###  **1. Clone the Project**
